Description: Collision Risk Models for avian fauna (seabird and migratory birds) at
    offshore wind farms. The base deterministic model is derived from 
    Band (2012) <https://tethys.pnnl.gov/publications/using-collision-risk-model-assess-bird-collision-risks-offshore-wind-farms>. 
    This was further expanded on by Masden (2015) <doi:10.7489/1659-1>, with code 
    heavily derived from this work and input from Dr A. Cook at the 
    British Trust for Ornithology. These collision risk models are useful for 
    marine ornithologists working in the offshore wind industry, particularly 
    in UK waters. Many of the species included in the stochastic collision 
    risk models can also be found in the North Atlantic, including the 
    United States and Canada.
